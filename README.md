# About
<h6> 
   &emsp; The Klon Centaur overdrive pedal is one of the most legendary guitar pedals in history and cultured a huge cult following. This pedal was designed by Bill Finnegan and an electrical engineer in 1994 with a common goal of creating an overdrive that preserves the character of the guitar and amp while adding grit and boost. This pedal caught the eye of legendary guitarists such as Jeff Beck, John Mayer, Joe Bonamassa, and so many more that used this pedal for their signiture sound. As demand grew, so did production stresses that made it really hard to meet the demand of the consumer. As a result, only 8000 units were made and the value skyrocketed to over six thousand dollars for a unit on the used market. The circuit itself was a mystery because the board was covered with epoxy to prevent copies. That did not stop the tone chasers as once the epoxy was removed, countless companies started producing clones to achieve the legendary tone.
